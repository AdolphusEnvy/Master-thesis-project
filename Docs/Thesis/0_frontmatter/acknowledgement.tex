    Finally, I have finished my masterâ€™s thesis, and prepared myself to graduate from VU Amsterdam. 
    The two-year study journey is a fantastic memory for me. 
    I met a lot of new friends, teachers, and strangers. I think I am fortunate: got a scholarship one day before the flight took off, got an internship at 510 of the Netherlands Red Cross, being offered an exciting topic for master thesis, got an offer from Flow before the pandemic, and the most important, I met my girlfriend at Decathlon after my third bike was stolen. 
    Here, I would like to thank my friend Robbie Luo, my supervisor Prof. Adam Belloum and Dr. Jason Maassen, my parents, and my girlfriend Minlan Cai. 
    Thank you all for the support to the master project work and the accomplishment in this two-year study. In this special year, it is you who supports me to step forward.
