The resource management is no doubt one of the key problems that all cloud or cluster need to face. 
Here, the special scenario the LOFAR team is taking: they build computation infrastructure of their own to process the data collected by the tremendous telescopes.
They are both cloud provider and cloud user. The jobs the cloud is undertaking are long and highly computation consuming.
The current horizontal distributed solutions, MPI and Spark, have intrinsic drawback on resource utilizing. 
To increase the resource utilization level, an auto-provisioning distributed computing system is designed. 
The auto-scaling mechanism enables the applications to dynamically fetch and release resources, and in the same time the resources of the cluster are maximally used.
The results shows:% TODO: add results and conclusions
