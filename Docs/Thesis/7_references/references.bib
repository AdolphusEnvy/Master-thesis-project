abstract = {The aim of the new generation of radio synthesis arrays such as LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is to achieve much higher sensitivity, resolution and frequency coverage than what is available now, especially at low frequencies. To accomplish this goal, the accuracy of the calibration techniques used is of considerable importance. Moreover, since these telescopes produce huge amounts of data, speed of convergence of calibration is a major bottleneck. The errors in calibration are due to system noise (sky and instrumental) as well as the estimation errors introduced by the calibration technique itself, which we call 'solver noise'. We define solver noise as the 'distance' between the optimal solution (the true value of the unknowns, uncorrupted by the system noise) and the solution obtained by calibration. We present the Space Alternating Generalized Expectation Maximization (SAGE) calibration technique, which is a modification of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, and compare its performance with the traditional least squares calibration based on the level of solver noise introduced by each technique. For this purpose, we develop statistical methods that use the calibrated solutions to estimate the level of solver noise. The SAGE calibration algorithm yields very promising results in terms of both accuracy and speed of convergence. The comparison approaches that we adopt introduce a new framework for assessing the performance of different calibration schemes. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Resource management in a cloud environment is a hard problem, due to: the scale of modern data centers; the heterogeneity of resource types and their interdependencies; the variability and unpredictability of the load; as well as the range of objectives of the different actors in a cloud ecosystem. Consequently, both academia and industry began significant research efforts in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent literature, covering 250+ publications, and highlighting key results. We outline a conceptual framework for cloud resource management and use it to structure the state-of-the-art review. Based on our analysis, we identify five challenges for future investigation. These relate to: providing predictable performance for cloud-hosted applications; achieving global manageability for cloud systems; engineering scalable resource management systems; understanding economic behavior and cloud pricing; and developing solutions for the mobile cloud paradigm.},

abstract = {The cloud phenomenon is quickly becoming an important service in Internet computing. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing is one of the most significant and fastest growing field. In this service model, cloud providers offer resources to users/machines that include computers as virtual machines, raw (block) storage, firewalls, load balancers, and network devices. One of the most pressing issues in cloud computing for IaaS is the resource management. Resource management problems include allocation, provisioning, requirement mapping, adaptation, discovery, brokering, estimation, and modeling. Resource management for IaaS in cloud computing offers following benefits: scalability, quality of service, optimal utility, reduced overheads, improved throughput, reduced latency, specialized environment, cost effectiveness and simplified interface. This paper focuses on some of the important resource management techniques such as resource provisioning, resource allocation, resource mapping and resource adaptation. It brings out an exhaustive survey of such techniques for IaaS in cloud computing, and also put forth the open challenges for further research. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Because of the vast range within the delivered Cloud solutions, from the customer's perspective of an aspect, it's emerged as troublesome to decide whose providers they need to utilize and then what's the thought of his or her option. Especially, employing suitable metrics is vital in assessing practices. Nevertheless, to the most popular of our knowledge, there's no methodical explanation relating to metrics for estimating Cloud products and services. QoS (Quality of Service) metrics playing an important role in selecting Cloud providers and also optimizing resource utilization efficiency. While many reports have got to devote to exploitation QoS metrics, relatively not much equipment supports the remark and investigation of QoS metrics of Cloud programs. To guarantee a specialized product is published, describing metrics for assessing the QoS might be an essential necessity. So, this text suggests various QoS metrics for service vendors, especially thinking about the consumer's worry. This article provides the metrics list may stand to help the future study and also assessment within the field of Cloud service's evaluation.},
