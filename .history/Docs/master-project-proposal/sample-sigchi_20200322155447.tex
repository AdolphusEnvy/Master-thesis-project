\section{Introduction}
The Netherlands eScience Center has developed solutions for calibrating imaged observation collected by LOw Frequency Array(LOFAR) telescope\footnote{\url{http://www.lofar.org/}}.
The LOFAR consists of 51 stations cross Europe and a typical LOFAR observation has the size of 100TB, after friquency averaing, the size can be reduced to 16TB. \cite{Spreeuw2019}
Collectively, there are over 5 PB of data will be stored each year. \cite{Start2020} To calibrate the observation by given sky map, SAGECaL is invented and implemented for this purpose.\cite{Kazemi2011}
By given pre-processed observation data, sky model and parameters, the calibration can be done independently. However, it is a compuation comsuming application. Currently, eScience Center has developed GPU, MPI and Spark versions for acceleration.
All of them have achieved great acceleration compared to the naive version. 

However, the solutions following horizontal scaling idea, MPI and Spark, will lead to a waste of computation resources in non-dedicated clusters.
In this project, we try to build up a system to achive auto provisioning at public clusters to drive the computation consuming applications. This solution can be applied to other more applications with the demond of auto-provisioning.

\section{The common issue on current versions}
Both MPI version\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nlesc-dirac/sagecal/tree/master/src/MPI}} and Spark version\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nlesc-dirac/sagecal-on-spark}} take SAGECaL process as a black box, it aims to schedule the task on multiple nodes to achieve acceleration. 
For MPI version, the architecture is master-worker like, but the task scheduling mechanism is very simple. In Spark version, the tasks are carried by driver with Java Native Interface. And each task is invoking encapsulated C++ program.
The common issue of MPI and Spark version is that the resources can be not be fully utilized in non-dedicated cluster. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/MPI_batch.png}
      \caption{Resources utilization of MPI batch jobs on cluster}
      \label{fig:MPI_batch}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/spark_NP.png}
      \caption{Resources utilization of Spark on cluster}
      \label{fig:spark_np}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{The waste of compuation on cluster}\label{fig:waste_cluster}
\end{figure}
The resource utilization of these two systems can be visualized as Fig. \ref{fig:waste_cluster}. As it is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:MPI_batch}, MPI jobs are scheduled as fixed batch jobs which are colored boxes in the figure. It is very common to meet the situation that all jobs in the queue are too large and the number of idle resources is not enough for the jobs in the queue. 
For Spark version, the possible situation can be visualized as Fig. \ref{sub@fig:spark_np}. The nodes should be reserved for Spark in advance and Spark handles the task scheduling. For typical Spark applications relying on RDD, the number of required executors can be up and down dynamically. Part of computation resources may be wasted since this computation power is exclusive for Spark.
However, of course, the current Spark implementation for calibration is based on Driver mode and the granularity is one executor per task. In this case, the waste of resources won't happen within the Spark cluster. But when there are a lot of idle nodes in the cluster that not reserved for Spark at the beginning, they can not be used for Spark. 


\section{Research question statement}
To tackle on the problems mentioned in previous sections,here, it can be summarized as the research question:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Is it is possible to build up a system/framework equiped with auto-scaling stratagy at resource level under public clusters?
\end{itemize}

Moreover, the following topics can be considered together:
\begin{itemize}
  \item portablility for utilizing remote (heterogeneous) resources
  \item data locality on cross regions 
  \item fault tolerence 
\end{itemize}

\section{Related works}
The common solution for managing resources is utilizing cloud management platforms like OpenStack or OpenNebula. 
Tania et al. \cite{Lorido-Botran2014} listed multiple methods for auto-scaling upon VM based cloud. However, in our case, the application is run in cluster instead cloud.
On the one hand , the VM is very heavy while our task is fixed. On the other hand, the middlewares need to be placed on node in advanced like Spark daemon, this leads to the same problem as Spark's.
Of course, the stratagies of resource management in this report and other papers\cite{Kang2013}\cite{Mao2011} can be applied in our project.
