\section{Introduction}
The Netherlands eScience Center has developed solutions for calibrating imaged observation collected by LOw Frequency Array(LOFAR) telescope\footnote{\url{http://www.lofar.org/}}.
The LOFAR consists of 51 stations cross the Europe and a typical LOFAR observation has the size of 100TB, after friquency averaing, the size can be reduced to 16TB. \cite{Spreeuw2019}
Collectivly, there are over 5 PB of data will be stored each year. \cite{Start2020} To calibrate the observation by given sky map, SAGECaL is invented and implemented for this purpose.\cite{Kazemi2011}
By given pre-processed observation data, sky model and parameters, the calibration can be done independently. However, it is a compuation comsuming application. Currently, eScience Center has developed GPU, MPI and Spark versions for acceleration.
All of them have achived great acceleration compared to naive version. In this project, we try to tackle on one common issue, dynamic management of resources, stemming from parallel solutions like MPI and Spark. The solution of this issue can be applied to other more distributed/parallel systems.

\section{The common issue on current versions}
Both MPI version and Spark version take SAGECaL process as a black box, it aims to schedule the task on multiple nodes to achieve scalability.
